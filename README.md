This week-long course will cover the practicalities of single-cell sample prep and analysis with a particular focus on single-cell RNA-seq libraries. This course is aimed at both wet-lab researchers interested in learning how to analyze their own single-cell data sets, as well as bioinformaticians who are new to single-cell sequencing analysis. Basic knowledge of the programming language R is a prerequisite for participation in the course.
